This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime. The solution demonstrates proper array traversal using a less-than comparison in the loop condition to avoid exceeding the array bounds.
